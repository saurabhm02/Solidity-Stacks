## Assignment: DAO Smart Contract Development

Your task is to design a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) using the provided Solidity smart contract structure named `DAO`. This DAO will allow investors to contribute funds, create proposals, vote on proposals, and execute them. Implement the following functionalities:

1. **Contribution:**
   - Develop a function that allows investors to contribute Ether to the DAO in exchange for shares. Ensure that contributions are only allowed within a specified contribution time limit.
   
2. **Redeem Shares:**
   - Implement a function that allows investors to redeem a specific amount of their shares and withdraw the corresponding Ether.

   
3. **Transfer Shares:**
   - Create a function to enable investors to transfer their shares to another address within the DAO.

   
4. **Proposal Creation:**
   - Develop a function allowing the manager to create proposals, specifying a description, requested amount, and recipient address.
   
5. **Voting on Proposals:**
   - Implement a voting system where investors can vote on proposals created by the manager. Ensure investors can vote only once for each proposal.
   
6. **Executing Proposals:**
   - Develop a function that allows the manager to execute a proposal. Ensure the proposal can only be executed if it receives the required quorum (specified as a percentage of total shares).
   
7. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Create functions to retrieve:
     - List of proposals created within the DAO.
     - List of investors in the DAO.


Ensure proper access control is enforced for manager-specific functionalities and investor-specific actions. The contract should be initialized with predefined values for contribution time, vote time, and quorum.
